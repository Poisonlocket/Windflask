# Windflask
<hr>
I have no Idea what this is going to be, im mostly just experimenting and learning flask. i've linked it up with tailwind considering normal css at this point on larger scale pages just gives me an annurism. Jokes aside im trying to find a comfortable Stack for myself and i havent jumped too deep into javascript so this will have to do for now.
